/**
 * Canonical registry of the operations the AI Builder agent can perform.
 *
 * Each ability is a thin, well-described wrapper over the same repositories and
 * services the REST controllers use. The registry is the single source of truth
 * for the toolset: the AgentOrchestrator calls execute() directly, and
 * AbilityRegistrar exposes the same definitions to the WordPress Abilities API
 * (WP 6.9+/7.0) so external MCP clients (Claude Code, Cursor) get an identical
 * toolset for free.
 *
 * The registry itself is a coordinator: the declarative definitions live in
 * AbilityCatalog, and the handler implementations in three collaborators —
 * ReadAbilities (side-effect-free GATHER reads), WriteAbilities (reviewed PLAN
 * steps incl. go-live/delete) and TestAbilities (live outbound probe/test
 * calls) — which the catalog binds callbacks to via reads()/writes()/tests().
 *
 * Safety model:
 *  - `scope` mirrors the API token scopes (read / full). The agent token has
 *    `agent` scope which ranks as full for writes but can never reveal secrets.
 *  - `requires_confirm` abilities (enable / delete / edit-live) are surfaced to
 *    the UI so they pause for an explicit user confirmation before running.
 *  - create_webhook always creates the webhook DISABLED.
